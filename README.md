Overview

This project demonstrates the application of statistical methods to analyze datasets in data science using Python. It covers essential topics such as measures of central tendency, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and error types. The project uses tools like NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize data.
Tasks Covered

    Statistics in Data Science: Analyzing the impact of outliers on mean, median, and mode.
    Measures of Central Tendency: Calculating and visualizing mean, median, and mode.
    Measures of Dispersion: Computing range, variance, IQR, and standard deviation with visualization.
    Hypothesis Testing: Performing a paired t-test to evaluate a study program's effectiveness.
    Types of Errors: Simulating Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing.
    Regression Analysis: Fitting a simple linear regression model to predict salary from experience.
    Underfitting & Overfitting: Demonstrating underfitting and overfitting with polynomial regression.
    Regression Comparison: Comparing linear, polynomial, and lasso regression models based on MSE.
    Correlation and Regression: Visualizing the relationship between two variables and fitting a regression model.
